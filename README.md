# Homework for Week 2
_(Scroll down for some reminder on cloning this repository and making commits)_

## Exercises:

### Exercise 1.)
- Create 3 variables:
    - The best thing that you did
    - 2
    - 3
- Then print out a string that says:  
"blablabla"

### Exercise 2.) 
- Practice VSCode! You will work in it a lot, so it's always good (of course this is something we cannot check here but we trust you:) )
  - Open a bunch of files
  - Open different workspaces
  - Create files and folders within VSCode
  - [Watch this video on getting started with VSCode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S320N3sxinE&list=PLj6YeMhvp2S5UgiQnBfvD7XgOMKs3O_G6&index=1)

### Exercise 3.)

### Exercise 4.)

### Exercise 5.)
- Find out (with Python!) if the following things are true or false (just print the results)
  - Is 3.14 equal to 3.14?
  - 
  - 
  - Is 5 equal to '5'?
  - Is True equal to 'true'?



## BONUS EXERCISES
You don't have to do these if you don't want, just if you are up to the challenge  
Also, don't be surprised if they are a bit harder than the normal exercises, you might need to do some research on your own to solve it.

### Bonus 1.)
- Create 2 variables and use them to print the following sentence:  
"The value of Pi is 3.14"
_(hint: joining floats and strings is not as simple as two strings, but you could google it, for example "how to join a float and a string in python")_
